# AISearchAlgorithms

This code was used for an assignment at UCF. I will ommit the class name to avoid other students finding this code to plagarize. This code is not to be copied and used in any way.

The assignment outlined a search problem involving different locations in the Harry Potter universe and two of its characters. Their goals being to travel to these different places and destroy horcruxes. Each character has a different cost to move and a different cost to destroy a horcrux.

With these parameters, different common search algorithms were employed to find the best possible way to reach the goal state where both horcruxes are destroyed. Not all of these algorithms take into account all of the variables in the problem, so some of these algorithms produce inefficient solutions fast, while others produce efficient solutions slower.

The following algorithms created for this project included:

- Depth-First Search
- Breadth-First Search
- Iterative Deepening
- Uniform Cost Search
- A* Search

The code can be ran on its own and does not require any outside files. For the sake of the assignment, the horcruxes are fixed in the two locations described in the assignment: Hogsmeade and Gringotts.
